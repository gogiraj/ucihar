#  description: 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#               2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#               3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#               4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#               5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
